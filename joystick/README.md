# Joystick #

The joystick code is designed to give inputs to the core software. It can run in either "virtual" or "physical" mode,
meaning the user can either launch this application with a physical Xbox 360 controller plugged into a USB port on a
computer or as a PyQt application that emulates an Xbox 360 controller. The library used for supporting the physical
controller was written by FRC Team 4564 in 2013.
